        <h2><u>About</u></h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Josphat Irura Mwangi, a passionate front-end developer and creative graphics designer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I specialize in crafting visually appealing and highly functional digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Front-end development:</h4> My journey into the world of web development began with the fascination of how apps/softwares and websites function. So in the year 2020 i began my journey into the world of web development by starting off with HTML and CSS. As i moved forward i sharpened my skills in the two languages then earlier in 2023 i dived into Javascript and React. By practising my skills in these languages, i have improved my skills by being able to turn concepts intobeautifully designed and responsive websites. I am dedicated to staying on top of industry trends and best practices to ensure that every project i undertake is not just visually stunning but also technically robust. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Graphics Design:</h4> Beyound code, I am also a dedicated graphics designer with an eye for aesthetics. I believe that design is a powerful language that communicates ideas, emotions and stories. I love creating visually captivating graphics, logos and illustrations that enhance the overall user experience. Whether it's designing a bran identity or crafting custom graphics for a project, i thrive on the creative process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>My Approach:</h4> I approach every project with enthusiasm, creativity and a keen attention to detail. I enjoy collaborating with clients and fellow proffesionals to turn ideas into reality. Problem solving is at the core of what i do, whether it's finding the best user interface solution or optimising a website for speed and perfomance, i believe that design and development are intertwined and the synergy between the two is what makes for exceptional digital products.
